  - title: "Magnetic field strength profiles"
    content: "Mass-weighted magnetic field strength versus radius at various times and intervals (using the median and interquartile ranges as colored extents) for the fiducial, weak cooling, and weak magnetic field simulations (from left to right). The shaded region illustrates the innermost kpc for which the statistic should be interpreted with care given the various active AGN model components."

  - title: "Entropy and cooling time profiles"
    content: "Median and inter quartile ranges (over time between 1.5 < t < 2.0 Gyr) of the mass-weighted mean entropy (top), cooling time (center), and cooling over freefall time (bottom). The shaded region illustrates the innermost kpc for which the statistic should be interpreted with care given the various active AGN model components."

  - title: "Mach numbers and plasma beta"
    content: "Median and inter quartile ranges (over time between 1.5 < t < 2.0 Gyr) of the mass-weighted mean sonic Mach (top), Alfvenic Mach (center), and plasma beta (bottom). The shaded region illustrates the innermost kpc for which the statistic should be interpreted with care given the various active AGN model components."

  - title: "Sonic mach number histograms"
    content: "Mass-weighted sonic Mach number histograms averaged between 1.5 < t < 2.0 Gyr of all simulations. The orange lines indicate the mass-weighted mean sonic Mach number versus radius. The shaded region illustrates the innermost kpc for which the statistics should be interpreted with care given the various active AGN model components."

  - title: "Temperature histograms"
    content: "Mass-weighted temperature histograms at t=1.6 Gyr (top panels) and averaged between  1.5 < t < 2.0 Gyr (bottom panels) of all simulations. The orange lines indicate the mass-weighted mean temperature versus radius and the shaded region illustrate the innermost kpc for which the statistic should be interpreted with care given the various active AGN model components."

  - title: "Time-averaged turbulent power spectra"
    content: "Median turbulent power spectra (with IQR in shaded regions) of the specific kinetic energy (left), the kinetic energy density (based on $\mathbf{w} = \sqrt{\rho}\mathbf{u}$, center panel), and magnetic energy density (right) between 1.5-2 Gyr for all four simulations. The slopes are just given for reference and do not imply scaling following a certain model or phenomenology."

  - title: "Instantaneous turbulent power spectra"
    content: "Instantaneous turbulent power spectra at various times of the specific kinetic energy (left), the kinetic energy density (based on $\mathbf{w} = \sqrt{\rho}\mathbf{u}$, center panel), and magnetic energy density (right) in the fiducial simulation. The raw, i.e., uncompensated, spectra are shown in the top panels whereas the spectra in the bottom panels are compensated by $k^{1.2}$, $k^{1.1}$, and $k^{1.2}$, respectively. The inset in the top right shows the kinetic energy density and magnetic energy density spectra at t=1.86 Gyr on one panel for easier comparison with the axis extents equal to the ones in the larger panels."

  - title: "Magnetic energy spectra"
    content: "Left: Magnetic energy spectra of the fiducial (green) and weak magnetic field simulations (orange) at various times. The vertical blue lines indicate scales for which the power is plotted over time in the right panel (normalized to the initial value at the particular scale)"

  - title: "Temporal evolution of the AGN feedback power"
    content: "From top to bottom: Temporal evolution of the AGN feedback power, instantaneous stellar feedback power (excluding Type Ia SNe), mass deposition rate, and total amount of cold gas. The extent of the lines indicate the runtime of the simulations. Given the 10x higher output frequency (every 2 Myr) in the first two panels the data is smoothed over 50 Myr using a box filter. The shaded region illustrates the time interval that is used to quantity averaged properties in other figures."
